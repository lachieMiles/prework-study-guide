# prework-study-guide

## I have built this basic webpage to understand the very basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in order to set me up for success in my upcoming bootcamp. The knowledge learned throughout this project has really helped me get my career off the best possible start, and I am excited to learn more complex HTML, CSS and JavaScript functions.

## I have learned how to problem solve, debug and look for errors in my code. I have also learned how to google different problems to help point me in the right direction of the issue in my code, and how to fix it.
